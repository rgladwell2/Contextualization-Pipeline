# Modeling Practice

Stuff to import at beginning-
#Load packages & model
import cobra
import xlrd
import pandas as pd
import pickle
from libsbml import *
from pprint import pprint
from cobra.flux_analysis import gapfill
model=cobra.io.read_sbml_model(“models/iPau21.xml”) #import model to manipulate
#iPAU1129 - from paper
#iPAU_V1 - first alina update
#models/iPAU_final.xml - current

import pandas
from time import time

import cobra.test                                      #all of this is imported to simulate knockouts
from cobra.flux_analysis import (
    single_gene_deletion, single_reaction_deletion, double_gene_deletion,
    double_reaction_deletion)










import cobra                  #gives access to CobraPy documentation
model =cobra.io.load_json_model("")                  #imports the specific model

for x in model.reactions:
    print(x.id+"\t"+x.name)            #lists all metabolic reactions involved
or 
model.reactions



model.reactions.get_by_id("")    # explains a certain reaction
OR
model.reactions.ID # put in ID
use modelseed database to look up reactions 



model.genes.get_by_id("") ##explains a certain gene
use Kegg to look up gene


model.metabolites # prints all metaboolites
use modelSeed to look up metabolites



    
Methods and their physical correlative:
lower bound of exchanges- nutrition entering cell
upper bound of exchanges - nutrition exiting cell

How to check flux of certain reactions after optimizing-
model.optimize().fluzes.reactionID

model.optimize().fluxes - fluxes for every reaction

How to export to an excel file-
soln = model.optimize().fluxes
soln.to_excel(“solution.xlsx”) #Save pandas dataframe to excel

How to set the media-
#Change media to LB media
model = changeMedia_PA_LJD(model,1)


Exchange rxns- in or out of extracellular space
Transport- in or out of cytosolic space
metabolic rxns- conversions inside the cytosol

how to change objective funciton-
model.objective = model.reactions.rxnID

how to add rxns to model-
#add ATP dissipation
reaction1 = Reaction(‘ATPdiss’)
reaction1.name = ‘ATPdiss’
reaction1.subsystem = ‘cytosol’
reaction1.lower_bound = 0
reaction1.upper_bound = 1000
reaction1.add_metabolites({
   model.metabolites.cpd00002_c: -1.0})
model.add_reactions([reaction1])
