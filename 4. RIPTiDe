##Creating a contextualized model

By now, you should have a location where your processed transcriptomic data and GENRE are stored. 

Start by downloading RIPTiDe in the anaconda prompt using: pip install riptide==3.3.5
Next we can enter jupyter notebook in the location where our materials are stored. Import everything for RIPTiDe and modeling:

import xlrd
import pandas as pd
import pickle
from libsbml import *
from pprint import pprint
from cobra.flux_analysis import gapfill
from copy import *
from cobra import *
from cobra.flux_analysis import *
from LJD_Functions_DDP import *
from DDP_Functions  import *
from time import time
from riptide import *

import cobra
import csv
import numpy as np

Next we need to read in our tsv with the following command: 
transcriptomic_data=riptide.read_transcription_file("Output.tsv")

Now to create the contextualized model:

model =cobra.io.load_json_model("Model.json")
for i in model.exchanges:
         i.lower_bound = -1000
Contextualized_Model = riptide.contextualize(model=model,transcriptome=transcriptomic_data)

CONGRATULATIONS! You have created a contextualized data set!
