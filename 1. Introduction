Welcome to the Pseudomonas Pipeline! THe purpose for this repository is to provide a tutorial for contextualizing metabolic models with RIPTiDe. I walk throug the process step by step, using a P. Aeruginosa model and relevant transcriptomes as an example. Essentially, the project can be split into 4 major phases:

Data Collection: If one desires to contextualize a model for a specific environment, it is important to find an appropriate, updated model first. Then, he or she must find transcriptomic data sets that appropriately reflect the transcriptional activity of an organism in a relevant environment. The model, or GENRE, and the transcriptomes and not necessarily easy to find. I provide the resources I used to find the materials for my project, but the resources are not limited to those alone. 

Data Proccessing: Transcriptomic data sets are extremely large, and usually a high power computer is needed. I am using the University of Virginia's HPC, Rivanna. The data must be made congruent enough to fit with the GENRE before it can be passed through RIPTiDe. 

RIPTiDe Processing: The GENRE and the transcriptome are passed through RIPTiDe to output the contextualized model. 

Model Analysis: The new model should then be explored and compared with others. It would be useful to compare the contextualized metabolic model to other contextualized models, or to the previously general model. Interesting trends can be gleaned through this analysis, which might lead to innovations in medicine or other fields, depending on the purpose for the project. 

The aim of this tutorial is to guide those through the process of using and understanding RIPTiDe, so more analysis of contextualized models can be done. Ideally, the procedure is clear and easy to follow.
