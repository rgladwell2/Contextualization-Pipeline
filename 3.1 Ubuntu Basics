Common commands or processses I used:

cd filelocation- moves into a certain location
ex cd /scratch/username moves me into my scratch or cd /home/username moves me into my home

pwd - outputs the current location
ex. pwd might output /home/usernmae if that is the current location

nano filename- creates a new file with the given name or moves into existing file with that name
ex. nano workspace  will either create a file named workspace or, if workspace already exists, move into it. 

rm filename- deletes files with the file name
ex. rm workspace would delete the workspace file

mv filename location- moves a file to a desired location
ex. mv workspace /home/username moves the workspace file into my home directory

sudo apt-get or pip.exe install are ways to install packages. Each package is different and it is best to look up how to install them on ubuntu specifically.

sqeue -u username - checks how long a process has been going for.
