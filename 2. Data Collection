#Data Collection


##GENRE
The first step is to find an up-to-date metabolic model of a given organism (GENRE).
GENRE's contain mathematical representations of all of the metabolic processes included in a given organism.
The model will be used in RIPTiDe as the foundational basis of the more contextualized model. 

There are many models for use on BioModels, a public repository for mathematical models. There are also easy to access models on GitHub.

For my project, I accessed my model via GitHub. The model is of P. Aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 and is named iPau21. 

Models can be in many formats, the most common of which are .json and .xml. Each of these require different syntax in order to import into Jupyter Notebook.
See "Importing Data" section for more detail


##Transcriptome
Next, find a transcriptome of the organism in a paritular environment that would provide the desired context for the model. 
Appropriate transcriptomes can demand extensive searching. However, they can be found in many places.
Using Google Scholar to find relevant research articles is an effective strategy, as the transcriptomic data sets are sometimes attached. NCBI SRA(Sequence Read Archives) 
is the definitive resource for transcriptomic data sets, but it can be challanging to find one that is ideal for the desired context. For that reason, it might be more effective 
to search for articles instead of navigating the SRA website directly.

For my project, I wished to compare the contextualized models of P. Aeruginosa in different infection environments in the human body. Using the article 
"Genetically diverse Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations display similar transcriptomic profiles in a cystic fibrosis explanted lung," I found a link to the transcriptome in the 
SRA database. THe transcriptome satisfied the projects needs. It provided data that could contextualize the iPau21 model to simulate P. Aeruginosa metabolic activity
in the human lung. 

I also used "Major Transcriptome Changes Accompany the Growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Blood from Patients with Severe Thermal Injuries" to find a transcriptome that
could provide context for P. Aeruginosa infection in a burn wound. The actual dataset was also stored in the NCBI SRA database. 

These two transcriptomes provided context for infections in different environments, which allowed me to compare the differences in the metabolic activity in these environments.
